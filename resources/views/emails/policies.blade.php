    <p>Dear Employee, </p>


    <p>Please go through our company documents attached and read the rule regarding attendance on the top of the sheet given
        below. You can just view your attendance as management is responsible to maintain the record.</p>

    <p>Besides, we have one more rule regarding daily update about accomplished/in process tasks by the end of the day. You
        will be penalized if you forget to provide summary of your daily tasks in #summary.</p>


    <p>Feel free to contact
        <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hr@glowlogix.com">hr@glowlogix.com</a> in case of any concerns and queries.</p>
